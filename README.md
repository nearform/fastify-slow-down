A slow down plugin for fastify

## Installation

```bash
npm i fastify-slow-down
```

## Usage

Register the plugin.
This plugin will add an `onRequest` hook to slow down replies if a client (based on their IP address by default) has made too many multiple requests in the given `timeWindow`.

```js
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import slowDownPlugin from 'fastify-slow-down'

const fastify = Fastify()

// register the plugin
fastify.register(slowDownPlugin)

// create a route
fastify.get('/', async () => 'Hello from fastify-slow-down!')

// start server
await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 })
```

The response will have some additional headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-slow-down-limit` | how many requests in total the client can make until the server starts to slow down the response
| `x-slow-down-remaining` | how many requests remain to the client in the `timeWindow`
|`x-slow-down-delay` | how much delay (in milliseconds) has been applied to this request


## Configuration

| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| delay | string, number | 1 second | Base unit of time delay applied to requests. It can be expressed in milliseconds or as string in [`ms`](https://github.com/zeit/ms) format. Set to `0` to disable delaying. |
| delayAfter | number | 5 | number of requests received during `timeWindow` before starting to delay responses. Set to `0` to disable delaying. |
| maxDelay | string, number | Infinity | the maximum value of delay that a request has after many consecutive attempts. It is an important option for the server when it is running behind a load balancer or reverse proxy, and has a request timeout. Set to `0` to disable delaying. |
| timeWindow | string, number | 30 seconds | The duration of the time window during which request counts are kept in memory. It can be expressed in milliseconds or as a string in [`ms`](https://github.com/zeit/ms) format. Set to `0` to disable delaying. |
| keyGenerator | function | (req) => req.ip | Function used to generate keys to uniquely identify requests coming from the same user

## Example with configuration

Registering the plugin with these options:
```js
fastify.register(slowDownPlugin, { 
  delay: '10 seconds',
  delayAfter: 10,
  timeWindow: '10 minutes',
  maxDelay: '100 seconds'
})
```

A delay specified via the `delay` option will be applied to requests coming from the same IP address (by default) when more than `delayAfter` requests are received within the time specified in the `timeWindow` option.

In 10 minutes the result of hitting the API will be: 

* 1st request - no delay
* 2nd request - no delay
* 3rd request - no delay
* ```...```
* 10th request - no delay
* 11th request - 10 seconds delay
* 12th request - 20 seconds delay
* 13th request - 30 seconds delay
* ```...```
* 20th request - 100 seconds delay
* 21st request - 100 seconds delay*

After 10 minutes without hitting the API the results will be: 

* 21th request - no delay
* 21th request - no delay
* ```...```
* 30th request - no delay
* 31th request - 10 seconds delay

*Delay remains the same because the value of `maxDelay` option is `100 seconds`
