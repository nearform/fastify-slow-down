A slow down plugin for fastify

## Installation

```bash
npm i fastify-slow-down
```

## Usage

Register SlowDown as a Fastify plugin.
This plugin will add an `onRequest` hook to slow down replies if a client (based on their IP address by default) has made too many multiple requests in the given `timeWindow` and
it will add `slowDown` request decorator, which is an object with the following properties:

| Name      | Type                | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| limit     | number              | the maximum limit until the server starts to delay the response          |
| current   | number              | the index of the current request                                         |
| remaining | number              | how many requests are left until the server starts to delay the response |
| delay     | number \| undefined | value of the delay (in milliseconds) applied to this request             |

```js
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import slowDownPlugin from 'fastify-slow-down'

const fastify = Fastify()

// register the plugin
fastify.register(slowDownPlugin)

// create a route
fastify.get('/', async () => 'Hello from fastify-slow-down!')

// start server
await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 })
```

The response will have some additional headers:

| Header                  | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `x-slow-down-limit`     | how many requests in total the client can make until the server starts to slow down the response |
| `x-slow-down-remaining` | how many requests remain to the client in the `timeWindow`                                       |
| `x-slow-down-delay`     | how much delay (in milliseconds) has been applied to this request                                |

| redis                  | `Redis` client instance from the _`ioredis`_ package | undefined       | by default this plugin uses an in-memory store, but if your application works on more than one server it is useless, since the data is stored locally. You can pass a Redis client here and magically the issue is solved. To achieve the maximum speed, this plugin requires the use of _`ioredis`_. Note: the default parameters of a redis connection are not the fastest to provide a slow-down. We suggest to customize the `connectTimeout` and `maxRetriesPerRequest` as in the [example]('./example/basic-redis.js'). |

## Example with configuration

Registering the plugin with these options:

```js
fastify.register(slowDownPlugin, {
  delay: '10 seconds',
  delayAfter: 10,
  timeWindow: '10 minutes',
  maxDelay: '100 seconds'
})
```

A delay specified via the `delay` option will be applied to requests coming from the same IP address (by default) when more than `delayAfter` requests are received within the time specified in the `timeWindow` option.

In 10 minutes the result of hitting the API will be:

- 1st request - no delay
- 2nd request - no delay
- 3rd request - no delay
- `...`
- 10th request - no delay
- 11th request - 10 seconds delay
- 12th request - 20 seconds delay
- 13th request - 30 seconds delay
- `...`
- 20th request - 100 seconds delay
- 21st request - 100 seconds delay\*

After 10 minutes without hitting the API the results will be:

- 21th request - no delay
- 21th request - no delay
- `...`
- 30th request - no delay
- 31th request - 10 seconds delay

\*Delay remains the same because the value of `maxDelay` option is `100 seconds`
